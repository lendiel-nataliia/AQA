Developing tests from scratch with your in-house development team
Using codeless test automation software designed for non-coders
Outsourcing your tests to a third-party QA service
Automated QA testing is important for companies that practice continuous integration, which means that software is developed, tested, and deployed multiple times per day, rather than in stages, as was common in more traditional development models.

Software testing is used to detect serious bugs and security vulnerabilities, as well as user experience issues, such as glitches that only appear in specific use cases.
